# Score-Keeper
This simple JS enabled application will help you keep the track of the scores between two players / teams. Use it for any game
accordingly and never fight over what the score is. 

Just enter the number till which you want to count the score till. On gaining 1 point increase the point of that player using 
the two buttons assigned for players 1 and 2. The person who reaches the winning point wins.
